I went away from Jekyll recently back to my beloved WordPress. What I found, was constant DDoS attempts and brute-force attacks against my WP installation.

I just wanted a stupid little site to jot things down.

So, back to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for super-fast site.
