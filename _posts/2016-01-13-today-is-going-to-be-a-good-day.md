I saw this little video that my mom had posted on Facebook. It inspired me as my wife and I just hit a pivitol parenting moment. I think that [Si](http://silasq.com) and I will recite something like this on the way to school from now on to get our minds right before the school day begins.

 Transcript of the video:

> Today is going to be a good day.<br />
I thank God for waking me up today.<br />
I am going to school so I can learn, and be the leader that God has created me to be.<br />
Today, I will be educated and empowered by my teachers, with the tools to be successful within my community and throughout the country.<br />
I apply myself daily.<br />
I study, and I ask questions when I don’t understand.<br />
When I’m confronted with a problem or a conflict, I think before I react.<br />
I ignore all negative influences in the classroom and throughout the school day.<br />
I am extremely proud to be the next generation of Christian leaders.<br />
I accept responsibility, and I love the challenge.

I wrote my own for my son and I to work on starting today:

> Today will be a good day.<br />
I thank God for this day.<br />
I am going to school so I can learn and be the leader that God has created me to be.<br />
I will listen, work hard and ask questions when I dont understand.<br />
When there is a problem or a conflict, I will think before I react.<br />
I accept responsibility for my actions.<br />
