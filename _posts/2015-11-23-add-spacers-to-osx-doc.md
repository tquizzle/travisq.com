Have you ever felt like putting a spacer in your OSX dock? I certainly have, and wanted to but never took the time to figure it out. Today I stumbled across [a post that explains it perfectly](https://awesometoast.com/add-spacers-to-your-macs-dock/).

You have to get into the terminal to do this, but never fear, it's your friend.

{% highlight bash %}
defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{tile-data={}; tile-type="spacer-tile";}'
{% endhighlight %}

Then you'll have to kill the Dock and it will relaunch.

{% highlight bash %}
killall Dock
{% endhighlight %}

Now just move that sucker around wherever you'd like it to go.
