Good, good stuff.


> 1. BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD
> 	- Speak with integrity.
> 	- Say only what you mean.
> 	- Avoid using the Word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others.
> 	- Use the power of your Word in the direction of truth and love.
> 
> 1. DON’T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY
> 	- Nothing others do is because of you.
> 	- What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream.
> 	- When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.
> 
> 3. DON’T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS
> 	- Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want.
> 	- Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama.
> 	- With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.
> 
> 4. ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST
> 	- Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are health as opposed to sick.
> 	- Under any circumstance, simply do your best and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.
